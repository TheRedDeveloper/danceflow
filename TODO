    parseAdditional in meta.ts parses the markdown contained in the comments of files in src/commands/
    parseKeys parses these and the @keys property in the JSDoc of files in src/commands/
    getKeybindings uses this info to create the keybindings
    from which pkg in package.build.json then chooses the correct keybindings
    src/api/keys.ts only contains "TODO" and was left like this 3 years ago
    src/api/commands/keybindings.ts is also left todo for 4 years
    This is crazy! This should be refactored immediately!
  
  All of this needs to be done at build time! NOT RUNTIME!

  ☐ Key handlers will be grouped as
    Editor:
      Global: `esc` `⎈p` `⎈o` `⎈r` ...
      Inspect → Inspect Mode: `f` `t` `z` `g` ...
      Interact: `y`/`⎈c` `[0-9]` ...
      Change → Move Mode: `d`/`⎈x` `⇧d` `⎇d` ...
      SelectedMove → Select Mode: `h` `j` `k` `l` `w` ...
      Move → Move Mode: `h` `j` `k` `l` `w` ...
    
    Menu: `h` `j` `k` `l` ...

    Let's just focus on the editor keybindings for now.

    ☐ All editor keybinds are prioritized as such
      1. Global
      2. Inspect
      3. Interact
      4. Change
      5. SelectedMove
      6. Move
      7. Select
    
    ☐ Default keybindings should be set on the ordered groups in src/keybinds/default.ts 
      The object I configure should be like this
      {
        global: {
          [`esc`]: "danceflow.exit",
          [`⇧1`, `⎈⇧g`]: "danceflow.togglePanel.git",
          [`⇧2`, `⎈⇧e`]: "danceflow.togglePanel.explorer",
          [`⇧3`, `⎈⇧t`]: "danceflow.togglePanel.testing",
          ...
        },
        inspect: {
          ...
        },
        ...
        selectedMove: {
          [`h`]: "danceflow.selectedMove.left",
          ...
        },
        move: {
          [`h`]: "danceflow.move.left",
          ...
        },
        ...
      }
      
  ☐ At build time we should find out a key bind's condition, having it deactivate when overwritten
    The move.left handler on `h` should be inactive when the higher priority selectedMove is active because it has selectedMove.left on `h`
    First we should separate out all the multi-assigned keybinds
    Then we should find out the condition of each keybind
    This results in an object like this
    {
      global: [
        {key: `esc`, command: "danceflow.exit"},
        {key: `⇧1`, command: "danceflow.togglePanel.git"},
        {key: `⎈⇧g`, command: "danceflow.togglePanel.git"},
        {key: `⇧2`, command: "danceflow.togglePanel.explorer"},
        {key: `⎈⇧e`, command: "danceflow.togglePanel.explorer"},
        {key: `⇧3`, command: "danceflow.togglePanel.testing"},
        {key: `⎈⇧t`, command: "danceflow.togglePanel.testing"},
        ...
      ],
      inspect: [
        ...
      ],
      ...
      selectedMove: [
        {key: `h`, command: "danceflow.selectedMove.left"},
        ...
      ],
      move: [
        {key: `h`, command: "danceflow.move.left", condition: "!danceflow.selectedMove.active"},
        ...
      ]
    }
  
  ☐ Every keybind should only be active when its corresponding group is active
    This results in a final object like this
    {
      {key: `esc`, command: "danceflow.exit"},
      {key: `⇧1`, command: "danceflow.togglePanel.git"},
      {key: `⎈⇧g`, command: "danceflow.togglePanel.git"},
      {key: `⇧2`, command: "danceflow.togglePanel.explorer"},
      {key: `⎈⇧e`, command: "danceflow.togglePanel.explorer"},
      {key: `⇧3`, command: "danceflow.togglePanel.testing"},
      {key: `⎈⇧t`, command: "danceflow.togglePanel.testing"},
      ...
      {key: `h`, command: "danceflow.selectedMove.left", condition: "danceflow.selectedMove.active"},
      ...
      {key: `h`, command: "danceflow.move.left", condition: "danceflow.move.active && !danceflow.selectedMove.active"},
      ...
    }
  
  ☐ Ensure that this works with unit tests
    
  ☐ Every mode needs to have a configurable list of active groups
    These will have to be made configurable inside package.build.ts inside "danceflow.modes"  
    Modify Mode:
    - Global
    Move Mode:
    - Global
    - Interact
    - Change
    - Move
    Select Mode:
    - Global
    - Interact
    - SelectedMove
    - Change → Move Mode
    Inspect Mode:
    - Global
    - Inspect
    - Interact
    - Change → Move Mode
    - Move → Move Mode
    
  ☐ Some commands ensure being in a specific mode before executing.
    ☐ Error if they can not switch into it.

  ☐ Remove the weird orange bar
  ☐ We completely disallow splitting it's distracting and ugly and just open another window with `⎈p`
  ☐ Hide tabs
  ☐ Hide the menu bar
  ☐ Hide the activity bar
  ☐ You should be able to move in the explorer with move keys
      ☐ `a` is new file, `⇧a` is new folder

  ☐ `'` Create jumppoint
  ☐ `[` To previous jump location
  ☐ `]` To next jump location
☐ Update object select `m￼`
☐ Make select mode work with VSCode find
☐ Add Inspect mode:
  ☐ `space` enter inspect mode or if a url/file is under the main cursor then follow it
  ☐ it should select the hovered symbols and hide the cursors
  ☐ multiple cursors → main cursor inspector is shown, rename on all heads
  ☐ `f` Go to definition
  ☐ `t` Go to type definition
  ☐ `z` Go to implementations
  ☐ `g` Go to references

☐ Scripting with live preview
  ☐ `/` to pipe each selection through a JavaScript Expression

☐ When over a new line character the cursor should extend infinitely to the right.
☐ There should be a tutorial
