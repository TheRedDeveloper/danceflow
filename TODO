✔ Fork the newest version of Dance @done(25-04-03 16:03)
☐ Change Readme, Extension Info
☐ rename “normal” → “move”, “insert” → “modify”, “visual” → “select”
☐ Add select mode
  ☐ Anchors stay when moving around
☐ Adapt modify mode
  ☐ Blocky cursor
☐ Keys will be grouped as
  Global Keys: `esc` `⎈o` `⇧1`
  Modify Keys: `d` `p`/`⎈v` `⇧p` `u`/`⎈z` `⇧u`/`⎈⇧z` `i` `⇧i` `a` `⇧a` `c` `r` `⇧r` `o` `⇧o` `tab` `⇧tab` `.` `enter`  `⇧j` `⎈up`/`⎈k` `⎈down`/`⎈j` `q` `⎇=` ****`⎈=` `⎈⇧=` `⇧c`
  Move keys: `h` `j` `k` `l` `w` `⇧w` `e` `⇧e` `b` `⇧b` `x` `v` `;` `⇧;` `⎇c` `⎇⇧c` `s` `⎇s` `⇧s` `f` `⇧f` `⎈f` `t` `⇧t` `)` `(` `)` `⎇(` `[` `]` `m` `⎈d` `⎈u`/`⎈⇧d` `⇧k` `%` `_` `"`
  Static Keys: `y`/`⎈c` `1` `2` `3` `4` `5` `6` `7` `8` `9` `0` `⇧q` `⎈q` `⎈⇧q` `space`
  ☐ Remove goto
  ☐ Remove align key
  ☐ Remove “buffers”, and “registers”, just the clipboard and files
  ☐ It should have `p` and `⇧p` reversed
  ☐ `⎈c` and `⎈v` still work the same
  ☐ `⇧;` not `⎇;` to swap sides, swap case is `⎇=`, lower is `⎈=`, Upper is `⎈⇧=`, `⎇c` is add cursor below, Comment is `⇧c`, `⇧q` records, `q` plays, `⎈q` loads, `⇧⎈q` saves macros, `⎈⇧d` is a `⎈u` alias and `⎈⇧u` is a `⎈d` alias,`⎈up`/`⎈k` increases numbers, `⎈down`/`⎈j` decreases numbers, `⎈o` pops this tab into a new window, `⇧1` toggles the explorer on the left
  ☐ Respond properly based on mode
    Modify Mode:
    Active: Global, Typing~self
    Inactive: Modify, Move, Static
    Move Mode:
    Active: Global, Static, Modify, Move~self
    Select Mode:
    Active: Global, Static, Move~self
    Breakout → Move: Modify
    Inspect Mode:
    Active: Global, Static, Inspect~self
    Breakout → Move: Modify, Move
☐ There should be a simpler editor window
  ☐ Remove the weird orange bar
  ☐ We completely disallow splitting it's distracting and ugly and just open another window with `⇧1`
  ☐ You should almost always be in zen mode
    ☐ with the status bar
    ☐ without centering
    ☐ with line numbers
    ☐ without tabs
    ☐ with notifications
  ☐ You should be able to move in the explorer with move keys
      ☐ `a` is new file, `⇧a` is new folder
      ☐ `r`/`F2` is rename
  ☐ You should be able to move in Code Lens and Code Actions with them too
☐ splitlines exclude Eol true
☐ Add to jump history, when changing more than one line
  ☐ `"` add jump location
  ☐ `[` previous jump location
  ☐ `]` next jump location
☐ Update object select `m`
☐ Make select mode work with VSCode find
☐ Add (hover) mode, it should have:
  ☐ `space` enter hover mode or if a url/file is under the main cursor then follow it
  ☐ it should select the hovered symbols and hide the cursors
  ☐ multiple cursors → main cursor inspector is shown, rename on all heads
  ☐ `f` to definition
  ☐ `t` to type definition
  ☐ `z` to implementations
  ☐ `g` to references
  ☐ `r` rename
  ☐ `⇧r` rename to clipboard
  ☐ `y`/`⎈c` yeet this symbol
  ☐ `⇧y`/`⎈⇧c` yeet the description
  ☐ `space` code actions if available
  ☐ `esc` back to normal mode
  ☐ `MOV`, `MOD` any move or modify key should exit hover mode and run
☐ Scripting with live preview
  ☐ `/` to pipe each selection through a JavaScript Expression
  ☐ `⇧/` to evaluate all selections in a JavaScript Expression, showing result below in the prompt
  ☐ `⎈/` to create a JavaScript file with a run function  somewhere which selections are piped through until the file is closed
  ☐ `⇧⎈/` create a javascript file with the selections as a constant *sels*
☐ When over a new line character the cursor should extend infinitely to the right.
☐ There should be a tutorial
